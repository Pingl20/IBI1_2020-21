SUMMARY
1. code
	a. creat a dictronary to contain the blosum
	b. open the files
	c. read lines in the file and seperate the sequence and the name into two different varibles
	d. use the dictronary to caculate the scores
	c. compare two sequences and count if amino acids are same
	d. use this count to caculate the percentage
2. results
	i) human and mouse
	   score: 1091
	   percentage: 0.8963963963963963
	   interpretation: these two protein sequences are very similar to each other
	ii) human and random sequence
   	    score: -250
	    percentage: 0.05405405405405406	
                    interpretation: these two protein sequences are not similar to each other. They are quite different.
	iii) mouse and random sequence
	    score: -250
	    percentage: 0.05855855855855856
	    interpretation: these two sequences are quite different
